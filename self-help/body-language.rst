Commandments for Observing and Decoding Nonverbal Communication
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1. Situational awareness
2. People's response to situation given context
3. Behaviors any/everyone does
4. Behaviors that NOT any/everyone does aka unique behaviors
5. Normal everyday behaviors for that person
6. Always try to watch people for multiple tells- behaviors that occur in clusters or in succession
7. Look for changes in behavior that can signal changes in thoughts, emotions, interest, or intent
8. Detect false or misleading nonverbal signals
9. Distinguish between comfort and discomfort to focus on most important behaviors
10. Be subtle observing others

Limbic Brain
++++++++++++
* Limbic part of brain = emotions, expressions, reflexes (most natural/ honest)
* Limbic responses are natural and difficult to disguise
* Neocortex part of brain = intellect, cognition, and memory (least natural/ honest)
* Neocortex is able to deceive
* Limbic Responses

  * **Freeze**: stay in place and avoid detection. Movement attracts attention. Can also diminish exposure by turtle effect.
  * **Flight**: escape, create distance, block, or lean/turn away from undesirable things. Tells you the person is uncomfortable or unhappy.
  * **Fight**: we turn fear into aggression. Verbal altercation is a modern way of fighting. We can be aggressive with our body language. Fighting affects our ability to think, due to heighten emotions.

* Our brain registers positive and negative experiences, so we can embrace or avoid those experiences again.
* Comfort = high confidence
* Discomfort = low confidence
* **Pacifiers signals discomfort. Used to calm us down.**

  * Shoulder
  * Arm
  * Hand
  * Leg (stressed, nervous, discomfort, anxiety)

* Read pacifiers

  * Establish baseline for the individual.
  * What event caused behavior?
  * Linking pacifying behavior to a stressor can help you better understand someone's emotions.
  * Say or do something to trigger pacifier.

Deception
+++++++++
* Society functions based on people's word.
* People mistake stress or other nonverbal behaviors as deception.
* No single behavior indicates deception.
* It's difficult to detect deception because we all get good at it, lying everyday for social survival.
* The new model is the Comfort/Discomfort Domain.
* People who lie would be more uncomfortable. Getting them to be comfortable will help reveal the limbic responses of discomfort.
* Your response can influence their comfort level. Remain calm, neutral, comfortable, and nonjudgmental.
* People are comfortable when they mirror (isopraxism) and non-verbals are in synchrony. Displays of comfort are more common in people speaking the truth. Look for discomfort.
* Try to remove objects to get the non-verbals of full body. The use of objects indicates the individual wants distance because they are uncomfortable.
* Standing displays more non-verbals than sitting.
* Liars will rarely touch you, depending on the relationship.
* Prolonged facial expressions are not normal and indicates discomfort.
* When uncomfortable, the limbic brain takes over.
* Look for pacifying non-verbals:

  * Get a clear view and have nothing blocking you
  * Expect normal pacifying behaviors
  * Expect initial nervousness
  * Get them to relax first before asking questions
  * Establish a baseline of pacifying behavior
  * Look for increased use of pacifiers and what caused it
  * Ask, pause, and observe
  * Keep them focused
  * Chatter is not truth, truth is reveal by verification of facts
  * Stress coming in and pacifying going out
  * Isolate the cause of stress
  * Pacifiers say a lot

* Look for synchrony between:

  * Verbals and non-verbals
  * Verbals and events
  * Events, time, and place

* Look for consistent verbal and nonverbal emphasis. Liars spend more time thinking of what to say and how it is being received.
* Lack of movement and emphasis indicates possible deception.
* Rogatory/ Prayer Position (Palms Up) indicates someone wants to be believed, and low confidence.
* Palms Down shows confidence.
* Territorial Displays, we take up more space when confident and comfortable. When insecure, we take up less space.
