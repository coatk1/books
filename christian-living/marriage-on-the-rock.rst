Marriage on the Rock
====================

Notes
=====
* God's Biblical roles help us have a lasting and satisfying marriage, because our spouse will meet our deepest need.
* A man needs honor.
* A woman needs security, through sacrifice.
* Women and children are a reflection (or heavily influenced) of the man/men in or not in their lives.
* The result of a wife is by the husband she serves, and the result of a husband is by the God he serves.
* In order to be a great leader, one must be humble and serve. Your leadership will influence those who you lead.
* Assume responsibility in fixing your marriage, rather than trying to reject or get a new spouse.
* Wives will respond to whatever their husbands does or does not do.
* Women can be both strong and submissive.
* The righteous spouse should treat the unrighteous spouse as they would Jesus. They will either repent or become convicted.
* Love them and confront them honestly about their behavior, in a loving way.
* Communication is the most important vehicle in a marriage.
* Your words are powerful so watch what you say and repent of any unholy language you used.
* Understand and accept the difference between men and women communication styles.

-----

Women's Basic Needs

* Security: create a home environment of stability and love.
* Purpose: balance home responsibilities and fun activities. They should feel a sense of purpose and productivity, while still enjoying life.

The Law of Priority
-------------------
* Your spouse becomes number one after God, if not, legitimate jealousy can form.
* "Leaving" your parents means they become a lower priority.
* One must not allow anyone or anything to replace the priority of one's spouse.
* We prioritized each other during courtship, but became complacent when we start to feel secure in our relationship.
* The best thing for children, is for spouses to love and meet one another needs.
* Children will eventually grow up and leave the house while your marriage will be the thing to remain.
* Protect priorities treating your time and energy like money.

The Law of Pursuit
------------------
* "Cleave" is to pursue and cling zealously.
* Maintain the energy you once used to pursue one another during courtship, in marriage.
* Otherwise you delay the inevitable by pursuing your new spouse after divorce. Why not start with your current spouse?
* 3 steps to renew love:

    * Remember when the relationship was enjoyable before you had fell off.
    * Repent from what is keeping you from your spouse.
    * Take action in doing what you did in the beginning.

The Law of Possession
---------------------
* Marriage is a union in which all things previously owned and managed, are now jointly owned and managed.
* This does not mean controlling or abusing our spouse, but rather willfully surrendering each area of our life to joint ownership.
* Can you trust your potential spouse with **every** area of your life?
* We must submit (not give up) everything to the authority of Jesus. Jesus will not compete with our possessions. To give up sole ownership shows trust. So we must do the same with our spouses.
* True intimacy is when two people lives are intertwined that one cannot determine where one start and the other begins.
* What would you sacrifice for your marriage?

The Law of Purity
-----------------
* God designed nakedness of marriage to include every aspect of our lives (body, soul, spirit).
* We are to be completely vulnerable without shame or fear.
* Sin creates shame, fear, and the inability to be open.
* The Bible is like the owner's manual for life. We trust the manufacturer and listen to the warnings.
* The manufacturer is telling us how to get the most out of life and how to prevent harm.
* Seven Steps to Purity in Marriage:

    * Take responsibility for your behavior.
    * Do not return sin for sin.
    * Admit your faults.
    * Forgive (unforgiveness damages you more than the offender).
    * Speak the truth in love (allow freedom of expression).
    * Pray for each other.
    * Seek righteous fellowship (don't be around those who seduce you to sin).

    * Is it hygienically and physically safe?
    * Can I do it with a clear conscience before God?
    * Is this someone I would want my children to practice in their marriage?

Tips for handling in-laws
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
* Honor: Grown and married children can still honor their parents while setting healthy boundaries. Parents no longer have an God-approved authority over the child's life. Show love and honor while maintaining boundaries.
* Separation: Married couples must have a healthy separation/ re-prioritization from their parents, to have quality time with each other and the children, in addition to building your identities. You need the space to be who God called you both to be. Problems with mother-in-laws:

    * Lack Other Fulfilling Relationships.
    * Identity is Tied to Child's (Triangling, Cross-Gender Identification).
    * Adversarial with Child's Spouse.

* Protection: Protect your spouse and children from interference or criticism by parents. Limit exposure to those who don't support or respect your values. Ten Commandments for Grandparents (pg.269).
* Friendship: View parents as friends, confront them the way you would a friend, respectfully.

Ex-Spouse
---------
* One must forgive their ex-spouse in order to have a healthier marriage moving forward.
* Inner vows are dangerous to one's spiritual and emotional health. It makes us God by saying what we will or won't do (note this isn't the same as boundaries).
* Being able to forgive (others as well as yourself) free yourself from your past.
* Receive God's grace in order to give grace. You cannot give what you don't have.
