Ten Laws of Boundaries
----------------------
1. The Law of Sowing and Reaping

  * Cause and Effect
  * Sow and Reap the Reality of Rewards or Consequences
  * Balance the following: Freedom = Responsibility = Consequences = Love
  * Balance between: Grace (unmerited favor) and Truth (structure)

2. The Law of Responsibility

  * Be responsible *for* yourself and responsible *to* others
  * Take ownership of your responsibilities
  * See Responsibility List below to see what you should take ownership of

3. The Law of Power

  * Have self-control
  * Make a choice
  * Have power over yourself not others
  * Know your limits
  * Adapt to what you cannot change
  * Accept reality

4. The Law of Respect

  * Respect others boundaries and their no
  * Respect limits and rules

5. The Law of Motivation

  * Do things out of love *not* fear, guilt, payback, approval or overidentification
  * Give in freedom

6. The Law of Evaluation

  * Difference between hurt (things that don't feel good) and harm (things that are bad/ unhealthy for us)
  * Evaluate pain caused by our choices and empathize
  * Turn pain from hurt into love
  * Accept pain (from hurt) to grow in character
  * Pain of staying the same or not changing is greater than the pain of changing or doing something different

7. The Law of Proactivity (Internal)

  * Avoid being passive and compliant
  * Reacting is necessary to express and own emotions but not sufficient for boundaries
  * Respond rather than react
  * Be proactive (solving the problem) instead of reactive (identifying the problem)
  * Stand by what you love/ value *not* what you hate

8. The Law of Envy

  * Appreciate what you have
  * Expect nothing
  * Avoid entitlement (when you think something is owed to you) and show gratitude (when we freely received something)
  * Difference between envy (want what others have) and desire (want what you value)

9. The Law of Activity (External)

  * Be active *not* passive
  * Take initiative and do not be lazy
  * Go after your goals
  * Do not be fearful of failing, closeness or conflict
  * Take risks
  * Closed mouths don't get fed
  * Difference between passive (not taking initiative) and dependency (need assistance) and patience (waiting for appropriate opportunity)
  * Difference between activity (taking initiative) and self-sufficiency (doing everything on your own)

10. The Law of Exposure

  * Directly communicate your boundaries (your property line)
  * Be loving, transparent (telling what is not asked) and honest (telling what is asked)
  * Preserve relationships

Resolution of Boundary Problems
-------------------------------
1. What are the symptoms? (Where did you lose control of your property?)
2. What are the roots/origin of conflict?
3. What is the boundary conflict? (What law of boundaries are being violated?)
4. Who needs to take ownership?
5. What do you need? (Can you find a support system?)
6. How do you begin? (Practice setting limits)
7. How do you set boundaries? (Say no to the bad)
8. What happens next? (Forgive, respond instead of react, love in freedom and responsibility)
