Notes
====
* Living By The Book, pg(s): 32, 36-37, 46-47, 55, 119-126, 182, 186-190, 205, 211, 224-226, 271-272, 301, 313, 321-322, 347-349, 359, 374-375
* "The Bible will keep you from sin, or sin will keep you from the Bible." - Unknown
* "The riches of God are free, but they are not cheap." - Howard Hendricks
* Studying the Bible is essential for:

    * Growth: we need the correct attitude, appetite, and aim/ direction (1 Peter 2:2).
    * Spiritual Maturity: this comes from spending time or having constant use of scripture to distinguish good from evil (Heb. 5:11-14).
    * Effectiveness: all scripture is inspired by God and are profitable for (2 Tim. 3:16-17):

        * Teaching: this helps structure the way we think.
        * Rebuke: informs us on what sin is.
        * Correction: a dynamic relationship with the word where we clean sin out of our lives.
        * Righteous Living: so we can be available for and to be used by God. 

* All scripture is inspired (or breathed out) by God. Breath can also mean Spirit, which connects to the Holy Spirit.
* The human authors were moved by the Holy Spirit, just as a ship is moved by the wind.
* The ultimate aim of Bible study is to know God. The Bible was written to change our lives. Have a goal in mind when studying the Bible, direction and diligence are key not speed.

Observation (What do I see?)
====
* Atmosphere: transport your senses to the passage, imagine yourself there when the author was speaking or writing those words.
* Goal is to observe, not just see.
* The more you read, the more you will come across new observations but it takes time and patience.
* Learn to read!
* Study by paragraph, not by verse or chapter.
* Study by segment, a collection of paragraphs united by a common theme.
* Use grid charts to help summarize paragraphs (part of a segment).
* Can also use charts to summarize an entire book.

Ten Strategies to First-Rate Reading
----
1. **Read Thoughtfully**: be intentional when reading the Bible.
2. **Read Repeatedly**: listen to or read aloud entire books (or even switch translations when getting bored). Each book is a unit and it helps to get the big picture.
3. **Read Patiently**:

    * Be patient with the text and with yourself. Take your time reading the Bible, don't rush the process or use other resources to replace your own reading.
    * Zoom out to get the big picture/ main concept of the book. [Purpose]
    * Zoom half-way for important events/ ideas from the paragraphs/ section. [Events/ Ideas]
    * Zoom in further for the details of the verses. [Terms/ Details] (Inductive/ Facts vs Deductive/ Opinions)

4. **Read Selectively (Zoom In)**: who, what, where, when, why, wherefore questions.

    * Terms: a key word that unlocks meaning of what the author has to say. These are the building blocks of constructing meaning.

    * Who:

        * Who are the people in the text?
        * What is said about the person or people?
        * What does the person say?

    * What:

        * What are the events? In what order?
        * What happens to the characters?
        * What argument and point is being made?
        * What is the writer trying to communicate?
        * What is wrong with this picture?
        * What was happening in the larger history of the world at that time?

    * Where:

        * Where does the narrative take place?
        * Where are the people in the story?
        * Where are they coming from?
        * Where are they going to?
        * Where is the writer?
        * Where were the original readers of the text?
        * Where does this book fit historically? In the Bible?

    * When:

        * When did the events in the text take place?
        * When did they occur in relation to other events in Scripture?
        * When was the writer writing/ when was this written?

    * Why:

        * Why is this included?
        * Why is this placed here?
        * Why does this follow that?
        * Why does this precede that?
        * Why does this person say that?
        * Why does this person say nothing?

    * Wherefore:

        * What difference would it make if I were to apply this truth?

5. **Read Prayerfully**: pray beginning with; adoration of God, confession to God, and finally petition to God.
6. **Read Imaginatively**: read the Bible from a different perspective to spark imagination; such as different translations, languages, and environmental settings.
7. **Read Meditatively**: listen for and fill your mind with the truth that God has revealed. It takes time to become holy so this should be a daily habit.
8. **Read Purposefully (Zoom In)**: knowing the structure of a book can reveal it's theme and purpose.

    * See *The Laws of Structure*.
    * Grammatical Structure: what is the subject, main verb, and object (SVO) in the sentence. Modifiers, prepositional phrases, connectives, clauses.

        * Verbs: words that tell us who is doing what.
        * Subject (Doing): who/ what is doing the acting/ action. 
        * Object (Receiving): who/ what is being acted upon.
        * Modifiers: descriptive words such as adjectives and adverbs.
        * Prepositional Phrases: tells us where the action is taking place. (e.g. in, on, upon, through, to, etc.)
        * Connectives: *but*, *and*, and *therefore* (typically has context for argument) are some of the most powerful words in the Bible.

    * Literary Structure/ Form (pairs): questions and answers, climax and resolution, cause and effect. What genre is this book written in. See *Narrative in Literary Sub-Genres of the Bible*.

9. **Read Acquisitively (Zoom Half-Way)**: find creative ideas to retain biblical text. (e.g. stories, skits, humor, drama, presentations, poems, songs, etc.) We only remember 10% of what we hear, 50% of what we see and hear, and 90% of what we see, hear, and do.
10. **Read Telescopically (Zoom Out)**: relate scriptures to their context as a whole/ zoom out. Look for connectives, context of surrounding scriptures, context of the book as a whole, and the historical context of the book.

The Laws of Structure
+++
* **Cause and Effect**: one event, concept, or action that causes another (key terms: *therefore*, *so*, *then*, *as a result*).

* **Comparison**: two or more elements that are alike or similar (key terms: *like*, *as*, *too*, *also*).
* **Contrast**: two or more elements that are unlike or dissimilar (key terms: *but*, *yet*).
* **Explanation or Reason**: the presentation of an idea or event followed by its interpretation.
* **Interchange**: when the action, conversation, or concept moves to another, then back again.
* **Introduction and Summary**: opening or concluding remarks on a subject or situation.
* **Pivot or Hinge**: a sudden change in the direction or flow of the context; a minor climax.
* **Proportion**: emphasis indicated by the amount of space the writer devotes to a subject.
* **Purpose**: a declaration of the author's intentions.
* **Question and Answer**: the use of questions or questions and answers.
* **Repetition**: terms or phrases used two or more times.
* **Specific to General, General to Specific**: progression of thought from a single example to a general principle, or vice versa.

Six Things to Look for in Scripture
---
1. **Things Emphasized**:

    * **Amount of space**: how much space is given to this subject?
    * **Stated purpose**: the writer framing the reader's thinking as they approach the material.
    * **Order**: the strategic placement of the material.
    * **Movement from lesser to the greater, and vice versa**: climax and pivots.

2. **Things Repeated**:

    * **Terms, phrases, and clauses**: repetition of these to emphasize their importance.
    * **Characters**: reappearance of certain characters.
    * **Incidents and circumstances**: repetition of particular incidents or a set of circumstances.
    * **Patterns**: created by situations that are related.
    * **New Testament use of Old Testament passages**: recollection of old testament passages to emphasize importance.

3. **Things Related**:

    * **Movement from the general to the specific**: the relationship between the big picture and the details.
    * **Questions and Answers**: the use of questions or questions and answers.
    * **Cause and Effect**: one event, concept, or action that causes another.

4. **Things Alike**:

    * **Similes**: a word picture that draws a comparison between two things. (e.g. *as*, *like*)
    * **Metaphors**: a comparison between two things without using *as* or *like*.

5. **Things Unlike**:

    * **Use of *but***: a change of direction or comparison of contrast.

    * **Irony**: the use of words to express something other than and especially the opposite of the literal meaning.

6. **Things True to Life**: principles that apply to your reality. Related characters in scripture to yourself and ask what would you do?

Charts
---

How to study a section/ segment
+++
1. Read the entire section.
2. Identify and label each paragraph. State the main idea or theme in each paragraph with one or two words.
3. Evaluate the paragraphs and use the six things to look for.
4. Evaluate how the section as a whole relates to the rest of the book using the six things to look for.
5. Label and summarize the main point of the section.
6. Record in your Bible a list of observations using brief and descriptive words.
7. Study the persons and places mentioned to get greater context.
8. Keep a list of your unanswered questions or unresolved problems for further investigation.
9. Ask yourself:

    * What have I seen in this section that challenges the way I live?
    * What practical issues does this passage address?
    * What change do I need to consider in light of this study?
    * What prayer do I need to pray as a result of what I've seen?

10. Share the results of your study with someone else.

How to create a chart
+++
1. Assign titles and labels that summarizes the material.
2. Ask:

    * What are the relationships?
    * What am I trying to show?
    * What's this chart all about?
    * When I've finished it, how am I going to use it?

3. Keep your chart simple:

    * What key data from the text ought to take priority?
    * What is the big idea?
    * What structure needs to be shown?
    * What material do you want to see at a glance?

4. Make several charts if you have too much data. Reread if data seems unrelated.
5. Be creative.
6. Revise your charts as you continue to study. Remember they are a guide.

Interpretation (What does it mean?)
====
* Questions: ask the Bible questions.
* Answers: will come from observation, spend more time observing than interpreting.
* Integration: reconstruct the meaning of the passage after you've taken it apart to inspect the details.
* Reconstruct the author's message and experience to get an accurate account of what did the scripture mean for him.
* The quality of your interpretation will always depend on the quality of your observation.
* Understanding the types of barriers:

    * Geographical barriers: not understanding a geography's history and it's significance. Use atlases.
    * Language barriers: understand the meaning of the root words. Use Bible dictionaries, interlinear texts, and commentaries.
    * Culture barriers: reconstruct cultural context (i.e. communication, transportation, trade, agriculture, occupations, religion, perceptions of time, etc.). Use Bible handbooks.
    * Literary barriers: understanding the different genres so you know how to approach each book. Use commentaries.
    * Communication barriers: you won't understand everything nor answer every question. We are finite while God is infinite. The best thing is to understand all the essentials for eternal salvation and daily living.

* Hazards to Avoid:

    * Misreading the text
    * Distorting the text
    * Contradicting the text
    * Subjectivism
    * Relativism
    * Overconfidence

* Differences in interpretation are fine as long as we know it's not the text that is conflicting, but our limited understanding. God is not confused about what He has said, even if we are.
* We also have the right to disagree with one another, as long as we are faithful and accurate to the text as we know how.
* Knowing the literary genre helps frame the readers mind on how they should read the text.
* To understand the author's terms, use concordances and bible dictionaries to get more context and meaning of key words or phrases used by the author.
* "When the plain sense of Scripture makes common sense, seek no other sense."
* God will never violate His Word or His character.
* The best interpreter of Scripture is Scripture.
* "90% of the will of God will be found from the neck up." - Donald Gray Barnhouse

Literary Sub-Genres of the Bible
---
* **Exposition**: an carefully reasoned argument or explanation of a body of objective truth. Pay attention to it's structure and the terms it employ.
* **Narrative**: a broad category of stories. Pay attention to:

    * Plot:

        * What is the development of the story from beginning to end?

    * Characterization:

        * Who is in the cast of characters?
        * How are they presented?
        * What roles do they play?
        * What decisions do they make?
        * How do they relate to each other, and to God?
        * What progress or regress do they make?
        * Do they fail? If so, why?
        * Why are they in the story?
        * In what ways are they individuals, and in what ways are they representative of others?
        * What do we like or dislike about them?
        * What would we do in their place?

    * Is this story true to life?

        * What questions does this story raise?
        * What problems do the characters have to deal with?
        * What lessons do they learn or not learn?
        * What things do they encounter that we should be sure to avoid?
        * Or how do they deal with things in life that are unavoidable?
        * What do they discover about God?

    * **Biographical**: the key persons in the story.
    * **Geographical**: the key location or place.

    * **Proverbs**: a short practical principle (not promise) of moral truth, that often is concerned about the consequences of behavior.

* **Prophecy**: to proclaim the words of the Lord, not tell the future. Re-create the situation using the **Read Selectively (Zoom In)** strategy, then look for:

    * What is the main problem that the prophet is addressing?
    * What images does he use to describe it?
    * What is the response of the people?
    * What does this prophet's message tell you about God?
    * What after this prophet delivers his message?
    * Why do you think God included this book in His Word?

    * **Apocalyptic**: cataclysmic events of global proportions having to do with the end of the world. Pay attention to the structure of the book. Refer to Old Testament for insights on the book's symbols.

        * What movement is there from opening to close?

Five Keys to Interpretation
---

2. **Context**: the text before and after.

    * **Literary Context**: context of a verse that belongs to a paragraph, a paragraph that belongs to a section, and a section that belong to a book.
    * **Historical Context**:

        * When is this taking place?
        * Where does this passage fit in history?
        * What else is taking place in the world at this time?
        * What were some of the social, political, and technological influences on the writer and on those to whom he was writing?

    * **Geographical Context**: 

        * What was the terrain like?
        * What topographic features made this region unique?
        * What was the weather like?
        * How far was this town from places mentioned in the text?
        * What were the transportation routes for these people?
        * What size city was this?
        * What was the layout of this town?
        * What was this location known for?

    * **Theological Context**: locate the passage in the flow of Scripture.

        * What did this author know about God?
        * What was the relationship of his readers to God?
        * How did people worship Him at that point?
        * How much Scripture did the writer and his audience have access to?
        * What other religions and worldviews were competing for influence?

3. **Comparison**: using concordances to compare Scripture with Scripture.
4. **Culture**: using Bible dictionaries or handbooks to gain cultural and historical context of Scripture.
5. **Consultation**: using secondary sources. However the order is: first the text of Scripture, then secondary sources. They are NOT to replace your own Bible study, but to assist in it.

    * Use Concordances
    * Use Bible Dictionaries
    * Use Bible Handbooks
    * Use Atlases
    * Use Bible Commentaries

Ten Steps to Figuring Out the Figurative
---
1. Use the literal sense unless there is some good reason no to.
2. Use the figurative sense when the passage tells you to do so.
3. Use the figurative sense if a literal meaning is impossible or absurd.
4. Use the figurative sense if a literal meaning would involve something immoral.
5. Use the figurative sense if the expression is an obvious figure of speech.
6. Use the figurative sense if a literal interpretation goes contrary to the context and scope of the passage.
7. Use the figurative sense if a literal interpretation goes contrary to the general character and style of the book (i.e. prophetic and poetic).
8. Use the figurative sense if a literal interpretation goes contrary to the plan and purpose of the author.
9. Use the figurative sense if a literal interpretation involves a contradiction of other Scripture.
10. Use the figurative sense if a literal interpretation would involve a contradiction in doctrine.

Figures of Speech
+++
* **Anthropomorphism**: the attribution of human features or actions to God.
* **Apostrophe**: addressing a thing as if it were a person, or an absent or imaginary person as if he were present.
* **Euphemism**: the use of a less offensive expression to indicate a more offensive one.
* **Hyperbole**: Exaggeration to say more than is literally meant.
* **Hypocatastasis**: a comparison in which likeness is implied rather than stated directly.
* **Idiom**:  an expression perculiar to a particular people.
* **Merism**: a substitute of two contrasting or opposite parts for the whole.
* **Metaphor**: a comparison in which one thing represents another.
* **Paradox**: a statement that seems absurd, self-contradictory, or contrary to logical thought.
* **Personification**: ascribing human characteristics or actions to inanimate objects or animals.
* **Rhetorical Question**: a question that requires no response, yet forces one to answer mentally and consider its ramifications.
* **Simile**: a comparison using "like" or "as."

Application (How does it work? Not if it works.)
====
* How does the passage work for you in your life?
* How does the passage work for others in their lives?
* Observation + Interpretation + No Application = Abortion (when you study but fail to apply Scripture to your life)
* Once we know God's truth, we are responsible for putting it into action.
* Knowledge without obedience is sin.
* Think of areas of our lives where we aren't applying Biblical truth, or are we applying it in *all* areas of our lives.
* Repent sin instead of rationalizing it. The more you rationalize, the more you convince yourself the word doesn't apply to you.
* Allow God's word to speak to your heart and act on it, not just have a emotional response.
* Don't use elaborate speech of Scripture to hide behind the truth.
* "Every time you study the Word of God but are not changed by it, it's as if you look in a mirror and see that you're a mess, yet you walk away and do nothing." - Howard Hendricks paraphrase of James v23-25
* How we apply Scripture is based on how we interpret Scripture. Interpret it wrong and you will apply it wrong.
* "Interpretation is one; but application is many." - Howard Hendricks
* Be careful on how you interpret, you will only multiply the error if you start with faulty interpretation.
* Allow the Word to convict our heart, in order to be transformed.
* Allow the word to convince us of what we need to do and what direction we need to go.
* Continue to be transformed by God's word. True conversion is a change of heart.
* We are God's workmanship; He created us for a specific purpose (Eph. 2:10).
* God designed us for a specific task/ purpose.
* To determine your purpose, know how God designed you.
* God created us for the times we are in, we were created "beforehand".
* Never try to "become" someone else. Always be who God made *you* to be.
* Become new not by changing yourself, but by transforming. Being sanctified is when God cleans up who we are.
* Don't do Christianity in isolation, get connected to other believers in Christ as well as those being transformed by Christ.
* We are made to fit into God's plan, not God's plan was made to fit into us.
* God's Word is always true and it doesn't change, but circumstances change.
* How people apply Scripture is different. It is based on things like:

    * **Education**: how people learn.
    * **Emphasis**: things people may find important in Scripture based on their gifts.
    * **Execution**: how people use their strengths to accomplish their assignment.
    * **Excellence**: how people are at their core, how God designed them.

* We are all designed differently and while God's Word isn't to be manipulated for our benefit, we must understand who God made us to be and acknowledge the differences in whom God designed other to be.
* Not all promises in Scripture are given to everyone, some promises were made to specific the individual. However we can claim promises made to the church and to those made to the righteous.
* "95 percent of the will of God is revealed in the commands of Scripture. If you spend your time attending to those, you won't have much trouble working out the other 5 percent." - Unknown
* Relevance in Scripture lies between God's truth in the Word and the world we live in.
* The Bible's primary subject is God and His relationship with humankind.
* Principles are general statements of a universal truth.
* "It's not difficult to be contemporary if you don't care about being biblical, and it's not difficult to be biblical if you don't care about being contemporary. But to be biblical and contemporary, that's an art." - John Stott
* The process to life-change and applying Scripture is done by:

    * Create clearly defined and measurable objectives, of what you want to change.
    * Create a specific plan on how you will achieve your objective.
    * Follow through and manage progress; either via checklist, accountability groups, or journaling. Questions to ask yourself are:

        * What have been the three greatest challenges to my walk with the Lord during this period?
        * How did I respond?
        * What victories do I have to celebrate?
        * What failures do I need to consider?
        * What specific answers to prayer can I recall?
        * Have I changed for the better or for the worse? In what ways?
        * Where have I spent my time? My money?
        * What has happened in my relationships?

* Progress is incremental no matter the size of the results. What matters is you're still heading in the right direction.
* Start a personal Bible study program:

    * Determine your objectives.
    * Establish your priorities.
    * Set a schedule.
    * Develop discipline.

* Starting in the New Testament is easier. Move onto Old Testament when you want more of a challenge.
* Keep a notebook and write down what God gives you.
* Start a small Bible study group of about 6-8 people.
* When leading the Bible study:

    * When asked a question you don't know, say you don't know but will try to find out.
    * Determine the purpose and time commitment of the group.
    * Ensure everyone gets a chance to participate, encourage discussion (ask open-ended questions) but still stick to the Bible.
    * Divide time between Observation, Interpretation, and Application.

* "Impression without expression equals depression." - Howard Hendricks
* The best way to share your results from studying Scripture, is through your life. Be an example.

Four Steps of Application
---
1. Know the text (observation + interpretation) and know yourself (your spiritual assets and spiritual liabilities).

    * Knowing your assets will develop your confidence, things God has done for you.
    * Knowing your liabilities will develop your faith, things God need to develop in you.

2. Is Christ the center of all areas of your life?

    * Personal life
    * Home/ family life (partner, parent, etc.)
    * Thought life (constructive thoughts, wider interests, Godly values)
    * Social life (friends, associates, etc.)
    * Sex life (healthy intimacy, honorable to God)
    * Business/ vocational life (business, workplace, etc.)
    * Church life
    * Community

3. Meditate on Scripture.

    * Memory is the key to meditation. You can only meditate on what you have in you (your memory bank).
    * Memorize Scripture with Topical Memory System.

4. Practice applying God's truth.

    * Ask yourself, Is there some area of my life where the truth is needed?

The Word
+++
* Once you have a new relationship with God and His word, you will have a new relationship with yourself, as well as a new relationship with the enemy.
* The Word exposes your sin. You and others are victims of the enemy, and not the enemy itself.
* The Word gives you God's promises, commands and principles, and examples to follow.

Nine Applicable Questions to Ask
---
1. Is there an example for me to follow?
2. Is there a sin to avoid?
3. Is there a promise to claim?
4. Is there a prayer to repeat?
5. Is there a command to obey?
6. Is there a condition to meet (typically with *if* statements)?
7. Is there a verse to memorize?
8. Is there theological errors to mark (often misinterpretations or misunderstanding of Scripture)?
9. Is there a challenge to face (where can Scripture challenge you to change)?

Know the Context When Applying Scripture
---
* There is context of Scripture and context in which we live.
* God's Word doesn't change, but our world does.
* What was the context back then? What is the context now? And what is the truth that remains true regardless of the cultural context?
* The more we know about the culture a passage was written in and to which it was originally applied, the more accurate our understanding will be and the use of Scripture applied to our own culture.
* What would Paul and the apostles say to us if they were writing to our churches today?
* Where would Christ be active if He walked among us?
* When studying context use a comparison (concordance) and consultation.
