* Generate win-win options
* Mutually agreed standards for evaluating solutions
* Thinking Fast and Slow

    * System 1: our mind is fast, instinctive and emotional. Influences System 2. Reacts to a question.
    * System 2: our mind is slow, deliberate, and logical. Guided by System 1. Respond to a question.

* Negotiation = Conversation + Rapport
* Mirror + Label = Rapport
* Accusation audit clears the air
* Summarizing interest and positions at stake

Summary
-------
* Build rapport with empathy

    * Mirror (with calm voice)
    * Label (Identify emotions and deepest need. Positive reinforce and negative diffuses.) and Accusation Audit (if necessary)
    * Summarize (Paraphrase + Label)
    * Discover Black Swans

* Asking questions (no-oriented and calibrated What/How). Give illusion of control by asking for help and get confirmation for implementation.
* Bargain (framing/ loss aversion, have an anchor or range, use precise/ odd numbers, and non-monetary items)

Isopraxism (Mirroring)
----------------------
* **Don't make assumptions. Be open-minded and gather as much information as possible.**
* **Focus on what the other person needs by helping them talk about their wants. Create trust and safety.**
* Focus on your demeanor and delivery aka who you are and not what to say or do.
* **Slow down and listen.**
* Your voice/tone is the most powerful tool in communication

    * **Late-night DJ voice**: downward, calm, slow voice. Shows authority, trustworthiness, and certainty. High tones show uncertainty.
    * **Playful voice**: the easygoing voice. Shows positive and encouraging attitude. Smile, positive mindset yields a positive response from others.
    * Assertive voice: creates push-back.

* We fear differences and embrace similarities (which builds bonds and trust).
* **Repeat last 3 words or what was just said. Be silent, so the other person can elaborate.**
* Steps:

    * Calm or playful voice
    * Say I'm sorry...
    * Mirror
    * Be silent

Labeling
--------
* Separate person and emotion from problem.
* Focus on interests (why they're asking).
* **Empathy: understanding your counterpart's perspective or point of view and vocalizing/acknowledging it. Understanding doesn't mean agreeing. Seeing why their actions make sense to them.**
* **Tactical Empathy: understand the feelings and mindset of your counterpart, but also hearing what is behind those feelings.**
* **Labeling: validating someone's emotions by acknowledging it. This helps to reduce fear in the amygdala.**

    * Label negative emotions defuses them. It clears the air and both parties can be in agreement.
    * Label positive emotions reinforces them.

* Words, music (tone), and dance (body language) says a lot about how a person is feeling.
* Use the phrases "It seems/sounds/looks like..."
* **Remain silent after label to allow the counterpart to respond/confirm.**
* Presenting Emotions: behavior that is above the surface that we can see and hear.
* Underlying Emotions: feelings that motivates behavior.
* Deal with negativity by observing it without reaction and judgement. Label each negative feeling and replace it with a positive and solution-based thoughts.
* **Accusation Audit: listing all negative things your counterpart could say about you.**

Beware Yes, Master No
---------------------
* No starts the negotiation.
* **No gives us safety, security, autonomy, and control.**
* Allow others to say no to you.
* **No doesn't mean rejection.  It could mean the counterpart isn't ready, comfortable, able to understand, etc. Can help by labeling their concerns.**
* **Types of Yes:**

    * Counterfeit: when someone plans to say no but feels saying yes will help them escape.
    * Confirmation: simple affirmation with no promise of action.
    * Commitment: true agreement that leads to action.

* **Guide your counterpart to think that the solution you want is their own idea. Let go of your ego or trying to persuade them.**
* **Ask questions that prompt an "No" answer.**
* Bad negotiators ask questions to prompt for a "Yes".
* Saying no can:

    * Open up other opportunities.
    * Allow real issues to be discussed.
    * Protects people from making incorrect decisions.
    * Slow things down.

* Every "No" gets me closer to a "Yes" - Mark Cuban.
* **Yes is the final goal but get your counterpart to say No before saying Yes.**
* **Mislabel a feeling to get a non-responsive counterpart to say No.**

Trigger Words
-------------
* Behavioral Change Stairway Model (BCSM)

    * Active Listening
    * Empathy
    * Rapport
    * Influence
    * Behavioral Change

* **Unconditional positive regard: accept someone as they truly are. When counterpart feels accepted, they are more likely to perform constructive behavior.**
* **Use a summary to get a "That's right" response. This helps the counterpart to open up, acknowledge what you said is correct and allows them to put their guard down and build trust.**
* Active listening:

    * Effective Pauses: being silent.
    * Minimal Encouragers: simple phrases that you are paying full attention.
    * Mirroring: repeat what was said.
    * Labeling: give feelings a name. (Identify)
    * Paraphrase: repeat back in your own words. (Re-articulate)
    * Summarize = paraphrasing + labeling (Emotionally Affirm)

* "You're Right" is synonymous to a Counterfeit Yes. 

Bending Reality
---------------
* **Don't compromise because it is easy and avoids conflict.**
* **Deadlines are arbitrary, flexible, and rarely have consequences. They causes people to rush decisions, to avoid missing out.**
* No deal is better than a bad deal.
* When someone issues a threat, they create ambiguities and loopholes.
* When threats are specific, they are most likely real.
* Withholding your deadline will cause impasse or for your counterpart to take their time and not get what you really want.
* Cannot use rationality to determine fairness.
* Our actual decision making ability is based on emotions, not rationality.
* People place a value on fairness.
* **Use of fairness:**

    * Defensive (Just want fairness) -> Get understanding/ clarity
    * Nefarious (Assuming what you have is fair) -> Respond with mirror and label
    * Honesty (Inform others you want to treat them fair)

* **Framing Effect: people respond differently to the same choice depending on how it is framed. Know the emotional drivers behind someone's values.**
* **Our perspective/ vantage point can determine our value placed on things.**
* **Prospect Theory: choosing options that involve risk, based on perceived gains. People are drawn to surety over probability (Certainty Effect). Picks sure gain.**

    * Anchor their emotions (show empathy and use accusation audit to prep them for a loss)
    * Let your counterpart go first (so you won't miss out on monetary opportunities)
    * Establish a range (to not give a direct answer but to force your counterpart to give the lower range)
    * Pivot to non-monetary terms (things important to you and not your counterpart, and vice versa)
    * Use Odd Numbers (seems though out and less likely to be negotiated off)
    * Surprise with a gift (people feel obligated to repay you)

* **Loss Aversion: people take greater risks to avoid losses, instead of achieving a gain. Avoids sure loss.**
* **When negotiating, it's just as impactful to show what your counterpart has to lose as well as what they have to gain.**

Illusion of Control
-------------------
* **Remove aggression by asking (what or how) calibrated questions.**
* **Acknowledge their ideas and get them to solve YOUR problem.**
* **Give illusion of control by asking for help.**
* Get them to unbelief in their position.
* He who has learned to disagree without being disagreeable has discovered the most valuable secret of negotiation. - Robert Estabrook
* Stay calm and have self-control.
* Soft words: perhaps, maybe, I think, it seems, etc.
* Calibrated questions help educate the problem, rather than telling.
* Hostage mindset: people react to their lack of power by being defensive or lashing out.
* Train neocortex to overcome emotions. Calibrated questions or an apology.
* Listener is always in control of conversation.
* **Don't force your counterpart to admit your right.**
* **Avoid Yes-oriented questions to prevent reciprocity.**

Guarantee Execution
-------------------
* **Ask How instead of saying No. Also prompts implementation. Asking How is a hidden No.**
* Let someone else have your way. - Chris Voss
* Let them define success

    * How we know we're on track?
    * How we address things if we're off track?

* Summarize until you get "That's right". Beware of "Your right" as they don't believe the solution is theirs. "I'll try" means they plan to fail.
* **Consider those not at the table, the can have influence on negotiation.**

    * It takes one person to screw up the deal.

* **7-38-55**

    * 7%: based on words
    * 38%: based on tone
    * 55%: based on body language

* Use labels to spot incongruousness.
* **Rule of Three: get someone to agree three times.**

    * Agreement
    * Label or summarize to get "That's right"
    * How or What questions about implementation and success

* **People who lie use more words, pronouns, and care more about people believing them.**
* **More important people,  speak in 3rd person.**
* **Less important people, speak in 1st person.**
* **Use your name to create Force Empathy, which means to humanize yourself.**
* Can express no up to 4 times before saying it.
* **Yes is nothing without How.**

Bargain Hard
------------
* **3 Types:**

    * Analyst: don't ask a lot of questions, use data to disagree, be upfront with issues, use labels.
    * Accommodator: use calibrated questions for implementation and execution.
    * Assertive: use labels, mirror, summaries, and calibrated questions.

* Black Swan Rule: Don't treat others they way you want to be treated, treat them the way they need to be treated.
* **Deflect anchors with calibrated questions and use non-monetary terms.**
* **Strategic umbrage: able to take offenses.**
* **The issue is the problem, not the person.**
* **Set boundaries by stepping back, until issue is resolved.**
* **Ackerman Model:**

    * Set target/ goal price
    * Set first offer at 65% of target price = extreme anchor
    * Calculate decreasing increments (85, 95, 100) = defined offers
    * Use empathy and different ways of saying No before counter = calibrated questions
    * Final number should be precise and non-round = odd numbers
    * Add non-monetary item they don't want

* **Be prepared. You fall to your highest level of preparation.**

Black Swan
----------
* **Let known knowns guide you, not blind you.**
* **Black Swan: hidden and unexpected pieces of information (unknown unknowns), whose uncovering has game changing effects. They are leverage multipliers.**
* Leverage: ability to inflict loss and withhold gain. What do your counterpart want to gain and what do they fear.
* Leverage Inputs:

    * Time
    * Necessity
    * Competition

* **Those with more to lose or afraid of loss have less leverage.**

    * Positive: ability to give someone what they want.
    * Negative: ability to hurt someone.
    * Normative: ability to use their norms and standards to advance your position.

* **Try to understand their religion: their reason for being.**

    * Review everything you hear.
    * Use backup listeners to listen between the lines, to hear things you will miss.

* Paradox of Power: the harder you push, the more you will meet resistance
* **Similarity Principle: we trust people who are similar to us.**
* Express passion for your counterpart's goals and for their ability to achieve them.
* **Don't assume your counterpart is crazy, that is often the time to discover black swans. Avoid common mistakes:**

    * Bad Information: not having all or correct information.
    * Constrained: not able to do something but don't want to reveal it.
    * Hidden Desires: having other motives.

* **Discover Black Swans**

    * Get Face Time: get to see your counterpart in person, to get more personal and see nonverbal communication.
    * Observe Unguarded Moments: people are more relaxed before and after formal meetings. Look out for how they respond to disruptions.

* Get over fear of conflict, especially from within the tribe or to be liked. Navigate it with empathy.
* Goal is to find the best possible deal and uncover value, NOT to strong-arm or humiliate your counterpart.
* Don't avoid honest, clear conflict.
