Notes
=====
* Essentialism, pg(s): 8, 22, 24, 111, 125, 229, 233, 242, 260-262
* Almost everything is noise, only a few things are essential.
* Make the wisest possible investment of time and energy to operate at the highest point of contribution by doing what is essential.
* Focus energy on a few things to achieve more, rather than multiple things to achieve less.
* Essence:

    * Have power and be in control of your choices (an action).
    * Filter out, discern, eliminate the noise to find the vital few (80/20 Rule and Law of the Vital Few).
    * Accept reality and be strategic with trade-offs (What problems do you want? What do I want to go big on?).

* Have the courage to live true to yourself/ be authentic.
* Explore:

    * Explore, listen, debate, question and think of all options.
    * Commit and go big.
    * Create space to focus, think, and read classic literature (that withstood the test of time).
    * Scan/ filter out noise (listen to what is not being said) and look for the lead/ big picture (hidden information and connection between points), don't get lost in details.
    * Seek different perspectives.
    * Clarify the question by getting into the field (What are you trying to answer?).
    * Write summary journals, a pencil is better than the strongest memory.
    * Make time to play (things you enjoy) and sleep (your best asset) to improve imagination and creativity.
    * Apply 90 Percent Rule for selective processing (Is this exactly what I'm looking for?).
    * Apply 3 minimum criteria and 3 extreme criteria to new opportunities. All 6 must passed for a clear yes, otherwise it's a clear no.

* Eliminate:

    * Walk away and don't conform.
    * Use essential intent (concrete, inspirational, meaningful, and memorable statement of purpose) to give us clarity and a proposed deadline (How will we know when we're done?).
    * Have courage, compassion, and clarity (of your purpose) to both gracefully say and demonstrate (no without saying no) a clear no. This will give you more respect despite current unpopularity.
    * Separate no from the relationship of the individual.
    * Focus on trade-offs (What are we giving up when we say yes) and remember someone is always selling you something (idea, opinion, exchange for time, etc.)
    * Ways to say "No":

        * The awkward pause
        *  "No but"
        * "Let me check my calendar and get back to you."
        * "Yes, what should I deprioritize?"
        * Say it with humor
        * "You're welcome to X. I am willing to Y."
        * "I can't do it, but X might be interested."

    * Have the courage to admit your mistakes/ cut your losses (regardless if it's a waste) and get a second neutral opinion (when trying to force something) in order to uncommit, regardless of cost or perceived value.
    * If you didn't have it, what would you sacrifice to obtain it?
    * Use zero-based budgeting (allocate all time, energy, and resources) to defeat the status quo bias.
    * Pause and think before making a commitment.
    * Use reverse pilot (removing activities) to face fear of missing out or disappointment of others.
    * Use editing to subtract/ cut out irrelevant options as well as condensing and correcting (quality check with our purpose) our activities. Also have discipline to show restraint of not removing.
    * Find and set boundaries (saying no in advance), giving you and others the ability to be free/ liberated and responsible. Create social contracts to set boundaries and find what you and another individual want to achieve.

* Execute:

    * Create a system to remove obstacles (make it easy).
    * Practice extreme and early preparation, and add 50% to your time estimate as a buffer for unexpected events.
    * Use scenario planning for project/ task buffers:

        * What risks do you face on this project?
        * What is the worse-case scenario?
        * What would the social effects of this be?
        * What would the financial impact of this be?
        * How can you invest to reduce risks or strengthen financial or social resilience?

    * Use essential intent to discover your desired outcome and remove constraints/ "slowest hiker"/ obstacles (by priority) to improve progress and maximize results.
    * If your constraint is another person, ask them what are their obstacles from achieving X and how can you help remove them.
    * Start small, visually (if possible) reward progress/ achievement (this builds momentum) and celebrate wins; to make doing essential activities effortless (make it easy and make it satisfying). This also allows us to enjoy and find satisfaction in the process.
    * Focus on the minimal viable progress (What is the smallest amount of progress that will be useful and valuable to get the essential task done?).
    * Perform the minimal valuable preparation (What is the minimal amount I could do right now to prepare?).
    * Start with small (4 mins) repetitions (with the help of a cue) to design a routine/ habit that enshrines essential tasks as the default position (autopilot).
    * Focus on the hardest thing first and tackle routines one at a time.
    * Mix up routines (weekly themes) to combat against boredom.
    * Take a moment to pause (slow down time), meditate, and refresh (being re-centered), in order to be focused in and enjoy the moment (What is important right now?)/ experiencing kairos.
    * Prioritize a list of things to get done and cross out anything that isn't important right now, at that present moment in time. Concentrate on one task at a time.
    * Take notes on ideas that may be useful in the future, to free up your mental energy.
    * Allow the essence (choice, elimination, trade-offs) of essentialism to enter your heart and mind, and to embrace the identity of being an essentialist (living a life of meaning and purpose, no regrets). Once essentialism is at your core, every decision you make will have cumulative effects on expanding your inner essentialist.
    * The essentialist path is one of clarity, control, and joy. Ask what is essential and eliminate everything else.
    * Knowing that our time on earth is short, gives us courage to make the right decisions and to be selective with our time.
