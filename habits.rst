* Habit: repeated behavior that becomes automatic
* Habits can be like compound interest
* They can be either positive or negative
* Focus on systems not goals
* Layers of behavior change:

  * Outcome (results)
  * Process (routine)
  * Identity (beliefs)

* Focus on who you want to become and not on what you want to achieve
* Laws of habits (break bad/ create good):

  * Cue/ Triggers (Can/cannot remember = Make it invisible/visible)
  * Craving/ Motivation (Feel motivated/unmotivated = Make it unattractive/attractive)
  * Response (Difficult to stop/start = Make it hard/easy)
  * Reward (Difficult to stay inconsistent/consistent = Make it unsatisfying/satisfying)

* OCEAN personality
* Choose habits that will work with your talents and personality, not against it.
* Goldilocks rule = peak motivation is between boredom and failure. We lose motivation if something is boring or too difficult.
* Threat to success if boredom, not failure. We lose consistency and motivation.
* Don’t become complacent on habits we master, otherwise we make small errors.
* Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery
* Don’t over identify with identity otherwise we fail to grow.

Cue
-----
* Have awareness of what your doing. Pointing and calling may help.
* **Implementation intention = I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]**
* **Habit stacking = After [CURRENT HABIT] I will [NEW HABIT]**
* **Place positive triggers in environment (make them obvious) to increase the odds of performing good habits**
* **Stay away from negative triggers (make them invisible) to avoid bad habits**
* Context and environment can become the cue
* **Change environment to change habits so new habits don’t compete with old ones**

Craving
---------
* **Make good habits attractive by, finding positive benefits and associating positive feelings with them (do something enjoyable before difficult habit to gain motivation).**
* **Make bad habits unattractive by, finding negative benefits, and associating negative feelings with them.**
* Dopamine is released both when you experience and anticipate pleasure
* The brain has more resources for wanting rewards vs liking rewards
* Temptation bundling = combine want habits with need habits
* **Habit stacking + Temptation bundling**

  * After [HABIT I WANT], I will [HABIT I NEED].
  * After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].

* We adopt habits to fit in with the culture/ environment to be accepted/praised.
* We imitate family/friends, the tribe, and the powerful.
* **Build better habits by joining a culture where the desired behavior is normal and you have something in common.**
* Cravings come from a deep underlying motive/desire. When habit fulfills motive, we develop cravings to repeat.
* Make habits more attractive by saying I *get* to rather than I *have* to.
* Prediction -> Feeling -> Habit

Response
-----------
* **Make good habits; easy to access, have less friction.**
* **Make bad habits; difficult to access, have more friction.**
* Practice > Planning
* Taking action > being in motion
* **Frequency of Habit > Time Spent on Habit**
* **Have your environment support making good habits easy.**
* **Habits occur at decisive moments. Each choice can lead to a productive or unproductive day.**
* **New habit should be less than 2 minutes. Easy to start of too big and not be consistent.**
* Make new habit easy to where it becomes natural.
* Starting your habit is better than reaching your goal.
* **Automate habits with technology or by making one-time decisions today that will benefit you in the future, enhance good habits and restrict bad habits.**

Reward
--------
* **Make it satisfying. Use immediate reinforcement to reward yourself on small wins.**
* **Make it unsatisfying. Add immediate pain/cost with accountability partner or a habit contract. Pain must be greater than the correct behavior.**
* What is immediately rewarded is repeated and what is immediately punished is avoided.
* Learn what to do based off rewards or punishment
* Positive emotions create habits
* Negative emotions destroys them
* The first 3 laws of behavior change = habit will be perform this time.
* The 4th law of behavior change = habit will be perform next time
* If immediate consequences are good, then later consequences will be bad. If desire for immediate is strong, the more you should question the action.
* Short-term rewards should reinforce/align your identity, then identity will become the reinforcer.
* **Habit Tracker. Should be automated.**

  * They are obvious/ visual cue
  * They are attractive/ motivating
  * They are satisfying

* **Habit Stacking + Habit Tracking**:

  * After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].

* **Don't break the chain.**
* **Never miss a habit twice!**
* Just because a habit can be measured doesn't mean it's important.
